    "# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1 + 2)\n",
    "## Finding the best neighborhood for my new Japanese restaurant\n",
    "*This notebook contains my submission for Capstone Project week 1 and 2 of the Coursera course 'Applied Data Science Capstone'.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "As a restaurant owner I would like to open a Japanese restaurant in Toronto, Canada. As I would like to maximize my profits, I am looking for a neighborhood that would meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* have a relatively high population;\n",
    "* have a low crime rate;\n",
    "* have a low number of Japanese restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the best neighborhood to open a new Japanese restaurant, we could use data science for supporting this business decision: The business problem is to find the best neighborhood to open a Japanese restaurant in terms of maximizing profits. Important assumptions I make are 1) a high population leads to more profits, and 2) a high crime rate leads to less profits. more people would lead to more business and more crime leads to less business).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audience\n",
    "Even thought this project is tailored to (potentially new) restaurant owners, the target audience is anyone who is interested in opening a business anywhere in the world. The techniques used here could also be applied to various other businesses (coffee shops, clothing stores, supermarkets etc.) and locations. Given that data is available, the sky is the limit. Combining data sources and datasets would lead to a even more comprehensive analysis."

    "## Data\n",
    "Since we would like to determine the best location for the restaurant using data science, one of the first steps is to determine what data we need, what data is available, and how we could use the available data to solve our business problem. Hereafter, I will describe the data that is available and that I would like to use to determine which neighborhood best fulfills the listed requirements above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High population / low crime rate\n",
    "Data about the population of Toronto, Canada is readily available. However, as we are interested in the population per neighborhood, this data is less easy to find. The Toronto Police shares [data on crimes in neighborhoods](http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/neighbourhood-crime-rates-boundary-file-) that also happens to contain data on the population of each neighborhood. Using this dataset, we can determine the numbers of crimes per neighborhood as well as account for the population (calculate crime rates) and determine the overall crime rate by extracting a new feature (i.e., taking the average of the rates for the different crimes). The dataset looks as follows and will henceforward be referred to as the crime dataset."

For instance, the neighborhood \"Waterfront Communities-The Island\" has a low crime rate for robbery and theft compared to break and enter. Let's now determine a overall crime rate for each neighborhood by adding the crime rates for all the crimes. Implicitly, I assume that every crime should be weigh equally, i.e., every crime is equally as bad. Of course, one could argue that homicide is a worse crime than auto theft, but for the sake of simplicity in this analysis they are considered equal."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "As seen before, Rouge seems to be the best neighborhood to start a Japanese restaurant. This neighborhood has a (relatively) high population, low crime rate, and only 1 Japanese restaurant. Other good candidates could be Woburn and Pelmo Park-Humberlea, although these have a lower population and a higher crime rate, respectively. Willowdale East has the most Japanese restaurants. A quick Wikipedia search learns that this neighborhood has a high number of immigrants from Asia, and thus it is not surprising that there are so many Japanese/Asian restaurants compared to the other neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhancements\n",
    "This analysis could be expanded by adding more data(sets), for example on the income per capita of neighborhoods, other types of restaurants, prices for real estate etc. In this way, the conclusion that Rouge is the best neighborhood could be further fortified or weakened.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "- Crime data might be underreported, incentive for police to understate crime\n",
    "- Data could be outdated, not up-to-date\n",
    "- Several assumptions have been made, these could be incorrect"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this report researched was the best neighborhood in Toronto, Canada to start a Japanese restaurant. The best neighborhood would be the neightborhood that fulfilled the following 3 requirements: high population, low crime rate, and a lower number of (possibly competing) Japanese restaurants. The best neighborhood to start a Japanese restaurant in Rouge."
